I'm a frontend engineer passionate about building scalable and performant web applications with React and TypeScript. My focus is on frontend architecture, UI/UX, and developer experience, ensuring clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

Currently, I'm working as a frontend engineer at [Rightfit](https://rightfit.work), where I built the MVP in 12 hours and scaled the platform from 300 to 800+ users in a month. Rightfit is redefining hiring by matching top talent with great companies based on proof of work.

Previously, I worked at **Merlin AI**, where I built **Vault**, a tool that lets users save anything from the internet and interact with it using AI. Worked extensively with knowledge bases and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Also developed an internal hackathon project similar to **Stack AI**, allowing users to build and run AI-powered workflows with a visual interface.

Before that, I was the **solo web engineer** at [Devdham](https://devdham.com), where I built the entire web platform from scratch, now handling over 2 lakh monthly users.

I work primarily with React, Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, ShadCN/UI, and Supabase. I also use tools like Storybook, Figma, and React Flow to build design systems and interactive interfaces.

Interested in frontend performance, AI-powered workflows, and building tools that improve developer experience.
